# Linear Programming Solver = Java
The solver has two working files, the `Simplex.java` which holds the class for the Simplex algorithm which is used to solve the linear program (LP). 
Secondly, the `LPSolver` utilises `java swing` to implement an UI for the LP. 

## TODO - Some ideas to improve the program
- [ ] Implement Interior Point method
- [ ] Big M method or e two-stage simplex method to enable the program to get a problem to feasability
- [X] Enable UI to keep track of the steps the solver takes
